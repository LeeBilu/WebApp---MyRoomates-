    In order to add another idea to the screen, there is a button with a prompt window.<br>
    Every Idea that is being added to the table have a delete button and a rename button to manipulate it.

    Issues during the exercise:<br>
    I had hard time using the fetch functionality because the express didn't sent the proper headers.
    In my opinion in the next exercise, it would be helpful to post in the exercise file that we should open the page in a
        static way and not using the webStorm options.
    Moreover, the fetch guide was lack of necessary information.
